    <p>Here is my first paragraph</p>
    <p>Here is my second paragraph.  It has an ordered list:</p>
    <!-- 		COLLEEN - You can't put a block element in a paragraph element.
     -->		<ol>
    <li>Alligator</li>
    <li>Zebra</li>
    <li>Bears</li>
</ol>

    <p>Here is my third paragraph.  It has some images.
        <img src="http://www.aacomedy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/images/artfair.jpg" alt = "">
        <img src="https://www.a2gov.org/departments/Parks-Recreation/parks-places/leslie-park/Galleries/Home/447.JPG?RenditionId=12" alt = "">
    </p>

    <p>Here is my fourth paragraph.  I am going to use Font Awesome to show a link to Facebook <a href="https://facebook.com"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a>  Can anyone figure out how to fix this?  Don't worry we will talk about it.</p>
