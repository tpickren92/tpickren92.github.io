            <h1>SI 422 - Needs Assessment and Usability Evaluation</h1>
            <!--<img class="imgr borderedbox inspace-5" src="../images/demo/imgr.gif" alt="">-->
            <p>For my Needs Assessment and Usability Evaluation class, my team and I took an in-depth look at the architecture and usability
                of the University of Michigans website for Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS).
                Given the importance of this resource for students--especially those experiencing mental health issues--we wanted
                to assess how well the site described and provided resources to the campus community.
            </p>

            <p>This decision was partly inspired by previous research and findings.
                In a 2005 study conducted by the university, 30% of the student population reported having sought
                counseling for mental health issues. This metric is very similar to the National College Health Surveys
                reporting of that year as well, for a myriad of mental health concerns.
            </p>

            <p>After beginning the project and conducting surveys/interviews based on the CAPS website,
                we uncovered a small segment of main concerns, the most obvious being that users were often unable to
                find the information they were looking for or became frustrated while searching for it.
                This meant that even though the information users were looking for was available on the site,
                the usability of the site somehow prevented them from accessing it. Therefore,
                conducting a usability test that might help us pinpoint where users got lost, confused,
                or frustrated on the site could help us create suggestions for improving the site for future users.

            </p>

            <p>In order to assess this, we focused on three different potential user goals:
                (a) finding help for one’s self, (b) finding help for others, and
                (c) finding resources for getting involved in the mental health and wellness community.
                So, we designed our usability script with these three metrics in mind,
                having people first think about their own situation, then about helping a friend,
                and lastly about getting involved in the community.
            </p>
            <p>These were guided by our overarching research questions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What is the overall user satisfaction of the site?</li>
                <li>How easily can users fulfill their needs?</li>
                <li>How easily can users navigate to the information/resources they’re looking for?</li>

            </ol>

            <h4>Personas</h4>
            <img  src="../images/si422images/SI 422 Personas Group.jpg" alt="">
            &nbsp;

            <h4>Process</h4>

            <p>Delving into the details of this test, we developed ten tasks inspired by the three core problems
                we identified: booking an appointment, finding help for a friend, and locating additional resources in
                the community. We focused on creating a range of difficulty and maintaining smooth transitions
                between tasks. Our introductory script included the required components--
                a description of the study and its purpose--along with an acknowledgement of the sensitive nature
                of mental health and reassurance we could stop anytime. We focused on writing a script that created a
                warm and safe environment for the user,
                one that would be conducive to long and detailed answers to our questions.
            </p>

            <p>Since previous experience with the platform could potentially affect the results of our test,
                we included a pre-questionnaire to get an idea of whether or not subjects were familiar with the
                site or had prior experience with mental health resources. We structured the post-questionnaire to
                include questions that were more subjective questions about how they liked CAPS,
                if they liked how it looked, and whether they found it frustrating or not.
                Our logging form included codes for minor and major incidents
                to ensure we could catch and record all experienced issues.
            </p>

            <h4>Findings</h4>

            <p>During our survey and interview we found that one of the most overwhelming responses we got from
                participants was how difficult it was to figure out how to make an appointment with CAPS.
                As we ran our usability test, we wanted to be sure that we tested this to really see how users
                found this information.  We observed that most users not only had difficulty finding the page
                with information about making appointments, but many users actually felt as though they had not
                completed the task we gave them, because they couldn’t find how to make an appointment online.
                Our participants were students at the University of Michigan (the target demographic of this website)
                and they consistently felt frustrated and unsatisfied attempting to not only find information
                about making an appointment, but simply spent a large amount of time trying to figure out
                how to make an online appointment.  The fact that they looked for ways to make online appointments
                (when the site does not allow you to) demonstrates two important findings.
                One, that the site should be much more clear about the fact that you have to make an
                appointment, and, two, that the information should be consolidated to one page that
                contains all the information about making an appointment.
            </p>

            <p>One overall experience that many of our participants voiced was that the website felt cluttered
                and some even described it as “information overload”.  They described how they felt that there was
                simply too much text and information on any given page, making it hard to pinpoint important
                information, or even want to spend the time looking for it through a sea of “stuff that just
                seems pointless”.  This shared experience by multiple users reinforces the idea that the site’s
                information needs to be consolidated and simplified to create a better user experience.
            </p>

            <p>Overall, users seem to be overwhelmed by the amount of information available to them and are even
                hesitant and discouraged to continue exploring the site because of the daunting amount of information.
                Given this information overload, users are not easily able to fulfill their needs, or
                easily navigate to the information and resources that they’re looking for.  We would suggest
                that CAPS seriously cut back on the amount of information the present on their website and put
                the most important information (making an appointment, finding help for a friend, and emergency
                information) front and center on the homepage.
            </p>

            <h4>A/B Testing</h4>

            <p>
                To conduct A/B testing for the U of M CAPS website,
                we first revisited both our research questions and the insights from previous group assignments.
                During interviews, there was one standout problem experienced by testers: they had difficulty
                scheduling an appointment and finding information pertaining to appointments on the website.
                Since booking appointments was also identified by our user survey as one of the most important
                features of CAPS, we chose to focus on this problem for our A/B tests. This addressed our research
                questions concerning the most important features of the site, if users found its navigation satisfying,
                and how likely people were to recommend the site.
            </p>

            <p>
                Having picked a topic, we brainstormed hypotheses for A/B testing. We wrote down several pairs,
                each focused on a different way to improve appointment booking. Then we developed criteria for
                evaluating the pairs: a good pair of hypotheses had to relate to our chosen topic, have clear
                independent and dependent variables, be feasible to carry out via photoshop, and materially
                contribute to the site’s user experience. Using these criteria, we chose two hypotheses:
            </p>



            <ol>
                <li>On the homepage, if we changed the “Clinical Services” tab name to “Make an Appointment”, then it would increase user satisfaction.</li>
                <li>On the homepage, if we referenced the “Clinical Services” tab in one of the three center content
                    blocks (the meet our staff block), then it would increase user satisfaction. </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Mockups</h4>
            <img class="one_half first" src="../images/si422images/Changes Text Only.png">
            <img class="one_half" src="../images/si422images/Changes Location Only.png">
            &nbsp;

            <p>Then we measured each of the independent variables of “text” and “location” with two dependent variables:
                ease of making an appointment and the relevancy of its tab. Hypothetically, the experimental
                version should increase both -- meaning users can easily and quickly find the booking tab.
            </p>

            <p>After collecting responses, we turned to analysis. Noting the demographics,
                there were significantly more students than non-students, more females than males,
                and most of the respondents had never used CAPS before. Then in Excel, we conducted T-Tests
                for each experiment (change text, change location, change both) vs its control. There were six tests
                in total, since we used both dependent variables. First, we quantified our A/B test responses.
                We encoded the Likert scale with values 1 (easiest) through 7 (hardest) to represent, numerically,
                the ease at which users could book an appointment. Then we encoded the text entry box with values 0
                (not mentioned) through 1 (mentioned) to represent the relevancy of booking an appointment to the user.
                Using these columns of numbers, we were able to complete the t-test formula in Excel and compute respective p-values.
            </p>

            <h4>Next Iteration</h4>
            <img class="one_half first" src="../images/si422images/Changes Both.png">
            <img class="one_half" src="../images/si422images/C-Changed Middle Box.png">
            &nbsp;

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>Our results indicated that changing the tab’s text from “Clinical Services” to “Make an Appointment”
                significantly increased user satisfaction; t-tests for both dependent variables had p-values less
                than 0.05. We also found that changing the tab’s location from the navigation bar to the content
                block materially increased satisfaction as well, with t-tests well under 0.05. But surprisingly,
                changing both text and location of the tab did not cause a significant increase in user satisfaction.
                Our p-values for that scenario were 0.16 and 0.28. These results were not as expected, and were
                probably due to unclear survey questions for that third scenario. In the future, we aim to create
                more straightforward questions and ask pilot testers if they feel the instructions were clear.
