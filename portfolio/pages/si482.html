            <p>Marco is a mobile app that my team and I brainstormed and designed that implements Augmented Reality
                and geolocation capabilities to help users
                locate their friends and family within a large crowd of people.
                Marco is all about allowing users to create, maintain, and share organic
                communities that spring up from shared experiences.
            </p>

            <p>mARco aims to be used by users who frequent music concerts and large conventions and gatherings.
                It is meant to be used when looking for a friend or family member who is attending the
                same event as the user. In addition, it can be used by people who are wanting to meet new
                people at these gatherings and events.
            </p>

            <p>Some of the basic functionality of mARco is to find your friends in a crowd, find new friends
                at events and gatherings, find event information, and help with coordination between groups
                of friends at these events. The user can choose between their camera view (utilizing AR technology)
                or a map view to help find their friends or meet new people. On both of these
                screens they can toggle between their friends, event information, people they don’t know,
                or all of the above appearing. The user also has full control of their own privacy so that
                either anyone, only their friends, or no one can see them. mARco can also be utilized to
                coordinate plans with friends by creating groups, inviting people to those groups, and group messaging.
            </p>

            <h4>Major Features</h4>

            <p>First, mARco feels like a direct extension of the event experience.
                One important design decision we made was choosing an unobstructed camera screen
                as the homepage of our app. We could have used a map view, social page,
                or even a newsfeed, but we chose to start with the camera screen because we wanted
                users to carry their real life viewing experience straight into our app.
                The result is a seamless experience that allows users to feel like they’re still
                present and immersed in their surroundings.
            </p>

            <p> Second, mARco not only locates friends, but also members of the public and event information as well.
                The app was initially just a friends tracker, but in response to user feedback,
                it has evolved over time to include a more comprehensive set of services.
                Now, users can go beyond keeping in touch with their friends and use the app to actively
                explore their surroundings (meeting new people and finding cool activities at the event).
                Since technology is commonly derided for making people isolated and less likely to have face-to-face
                interaction, we’re excited that mARco promotes just the opposite.
            </p>

            <h4>Tools and Approach</h4>
            <p class="center">QOCs</p>
            <div>
                <img class="one_half first"  src="../images/si482images/QuestionsOptionsCriteria1.jpeg" alt="">
                <img class="one_half" src="../images/si482images/QuestionsOptionsCriteria2.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            &nbsp;

            <p>To complete this project, we used a variety of tools and approaches. The tools that stand out most are
                Figma and Sketch--we used them to coordinate design efforts among our team
                and to finish the high fidelity designs in Sketch.
                Besides tools, there were two approaches that most shaped our project.
                The first was the competitive analysis that we conducted near the beginning of the semester.
                This analysis revealed popular features and drawbacks of other location services apps
                (such as Find My Friends, Facebook Messenger, etc.) and it greatly influenced us choosing
                AR scanning as our main and differentiating feature. The second approach we found useful was the
                Paper Prototyping. This allowed us to test out a couple of different navigation patterns and
                which revealed which one was most intuitive. It would a big reason why we chose to adopt a
                fixed tab navigation instead of a hamburger menu, and thus had a huge impact on the overall experience using our app.

            <h4>Design Evolution</h4>
            <!--wireframe here-->

            <p>From the usability defect testing and paper-prototyping, we have found that the lack of a proper
                navbar confused our testers with the general flow of our application. Our initial implementation
                of a menu was a lone hamburger menu at the top-left of our interfaces. However, one of our
                classmate testers noted that he should be able to access any major interface from within a subsidiary
                interface, and that wasn’t possible with the common placements of the hamburger menu button and the
                back button. This navbar implementation lead to our major change in application navigation and
                reorganization of interface hierarchy to come.

            </p>

            <p>Throughout the whole design process of mARco, we focused heavily on the two major functionalities
                and interfaces: scanning and social interfaces. Therefore the majority of  design evolution
                came from interfaces regarding these two major features. For example, for the scanning interface,
                our navbar and filter options menu have changed in its orientation, location, and properties.
                We originally had planned to not have a navbar at all, as we didn’t realize how big of a role the
                social aspects played within our application. However, as the design process continued, we received
                feedbacks about social features from groups, events, to friends which lead us to implementing a navbar.
                Along with the implementation of a navbar, the positioning and orientation of the filter options needed
                new adjustments. With the use-case of our user scanning in a large and crowded area, we ultimately
                decided to place the filter options on the lower half of the screen for easiest access.
            </p>

            <p class="center">Initial Wireframes</p>
            <img class="one_third first"  src="../images/si482images/wireframe1.png" alt="">
            <img class="one_third" src="../images/si482images/wireframe3.png" alt="">
            <img class="one_third" src="../images/si482images/wireframe8.png" alt="">
            &nbsp;

            <p>Another major change we implemented was the privacy options placement within our application.
                We received a great feedback from our GSI, Raden, about how our original placement of
                the privacy settings button wasn’t visible enough, and therefore the amount of importance
                put forth to our users was lacking. To address this in two-fold: we created a Profile tab
                for users be able to quickly see and access his/her privacy settings, and color-coded privacy
                settings throughout the application for all three major components of mARco: users, group, and events.
                During the presentation, we also received positive feedbacks about the ease of visually being able to
                differentiate the privacy setting of a component without reading a single word.
            </p>

            <p class="center">Wireframe Iteration</p>
            <img class="one_third first"  src="../images/si482images/A2.png" alt="">
            <img class="one_third" src="../images/si482images/B2.png" alt="">
            <img class="one_third" src="../images/si482images/B6.png" alt="">
            &nbsp;

            <p>Overall, our team believes that the paper-prototyping and usability defects testing were the best
                methods within the design process. These two design methods provided our team with strong pros
                with which we were able to design our application upon: as week 7’s readings on paper prototyping
                suggested, being able to implement these tests within any point in the design process, and the ability
                to quickly gather and implement on designs. We learned that paper-prototyping is a powerful tool that
                can provide you with quick and tangible results, that is often underestimated among many designers.
            </p>

            <h4>Impact</h4>
            <img src="../images/si482images/SI 482 Final Poster.png" alt="">

            <p>Our design could meaningfully impact the way that people interact with each other and the events
                that they attend. The solution that we have come up with removes the effort and time it takes
                to try and find your friend in a large crowd, as well as the time it takes to find something
                like a bathroom or food cart. By reducing this time spent trying to coordinate plans and find
                someone in a large crowd, we allow people to have more time to interact with one another and
                enjoy the time they are spending together. When a user opens mARco, they are immediately taken
                to our main screen where they see their camera open and the utilization of AR.
                Our hope here was to make the app an extension of the event so that users did not have to bury
                their face in the phone and not see what’s going on around them. This use of technology really
                allows users to engage more fully with their surroundings, while still using our app.
                Overall, our goal was to give users a seamless and easy way to find their friends and increase time
                spent at an event engaging with people they want to engage with.
